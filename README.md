# MovieRecommendation System

As a group, we built a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering. This technique employs **neural networks** to learn the similarities between user and movie embeddings based on their interactions, and uses this information to provide personalized recommendations. 

Implemented and evaluated performances of three different models, two of them using implicit feedback and predicting whether a user would like a movie or not. One of these models was built using pure PyTorch and the other using PyTorch's Lightning library. The third model used explicit feedback to predict the exact rating a user would give to a movie, using PyTorch again. Also employed t-SNE in order to understand our data better by visualizing it in a lower-dimensonal space.

Mostly used Python, NumPy, PyTorch, Lightning, Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

More detailed explanation of the project and its implementation can be found in the [report.](https://github.com/KaanTekTr/MovieRecommender/blob/main/Group11_CS464_Final_Report.pdf)
